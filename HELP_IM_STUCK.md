# Stuck? Try this . . .

1. Start with a simpler version of the problem: a single lowercase word and a
   small, fixed shift.
2. I **strongly** suggest picking a few example message to encrypt and decrypt
   by hand. Doing so will let you focus on the problem rather than the code.
3. Try to distill your process into a set of repeatable steps.
4. Use those steps to write some pseudocode.
5. If you need to accomplish something in Python but you aren't sure how to do
   it:
   - Open up a Python REPL in your terminal and experiment.
   - Look up the documentation for the function or concept you're trying to use.
   - Try to formulate a precise question that you can ask or Google.
6. Write a couple of test cases and make sure they pass.
7. Once you've solved the simpler problem, build on your solution:
   - handle multiple words and punctuation
   - handle uppercase letters
